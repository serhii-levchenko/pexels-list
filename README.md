## Test task with Image feed

- caching and pagination are done using "react-query"
- "flash-list" and "expo-image" are used for better UX (the content is appearing faster than using default RN components)
- "pull-to-refresh" is based on "react-query" refetch
- "pexels" library is used for defined types
- image details view is implemented on RN modal
